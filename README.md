# Excel Data Consolidation Tool (VBA)

A simple and reusable Excel VBA utility to merge multiple Excel files into a single consolidated workbook.

This tool is designed for real-world data operations where:
- Multiple Excel files exist in a folder  
- Each file contains multiple sheets  
- Sheet names may repeat across files  
- Column headers may appear in different orders  
- Data needs to be appended and aligned correctly  

---

## 🚀 Features

- Select a folder and automatically merge all Excel files
- Combine same sheet names into a single `_Combined` sheet
- Align columns by header name (even if column order is shuffled)
- Append all rows safely without overwriting original files
- Fully dynamic: supports any number of files, sheets, rows, and columns
- Replaces old combined file if already present

## 🧠 Use Case

- Data Analysts
